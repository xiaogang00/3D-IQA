# 3D-IQA
This is the code and paper for the research project of Stereoscopic Image Quality Assessment

* In the file of NR-3D-IQA, there is the code for my paper "No-reference Stereoscopic Image Quality
  Assessment with Saliency-guided Binocular Feature Consolidation"
* In the file of FR-3D-IQA, there is the code for my paper "Stereoscopic Image Quality Assessment by
  Analyzing Depth and Local Texture Information"
* In the file of Experiment is some code when I write when I do experiment of IQA and other related field.
* In the file of Visual comfort assessment, which is the topic I have researched, there is the code written by me and the reference paper I read.
